## CONTRIBUTING Guide

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

The following are the guidelines for contributing to TeamFormationAssistant on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules.

### Before Getting Started

- Know the packages you need.
- Make sure you know the design decisions you are aiming for.
  - when you make a significant decision, you need to know how to maintain the project and what you can or cannot support.
  - submit the meaningful questions.

### Getting Started

- Make sure you have a GitHub account.

- Ask for permission, and then fork a branch to start developing!

### How to Contribute

1. Bug reports - When submitting a bug report, please include as many details as possible. The additional information will be helpful since it can help resolve the problem faster. 

2. Enhancements -  You can submit an enhancement suggestion for our project, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. You will need to suggest as many details as possible, which can help us understand the suggestion and find  related suggestions.

3. Pulling - After an enchancement suggestion is approved, you can start developing this enhancement by forking the repository and developing on your own. However, your pull request will need to be approved.

4. Pushing - When requesting to merge the branch back to main, make sure none of the major functionality of this app are broken and to fix as many bugs as possible. The merge request will be approved or denied depending on the functionality implemented and the amount of bugs found from the new code written. 

### Documentation Guide

- Use markdown for .md documents.
- Make sure to comment on all functions and classes created about their functionality, inputs, and outputs.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain project quality.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working.
- Enable a sustainable system for project maintainers to review contributions.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

### Committing Changes

You first need to follow the pull request above.

Then, please avoid working directly on master branch and you need to create a new branch from where you want to start your work.

Last but not least, you need to write meaningful commit messages and test for your changes.

### Submitting Changes

- Push the changes to the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository and follow the pull requests above.
- Wait for feedback on the request.
