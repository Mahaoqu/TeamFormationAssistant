|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes moreproductive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|  https://github.com/yliang123/TeamFormationAssistant/graphs/commit-activity|
| Number of commits|3| https://github.com/yliang123/TeamFormationAssistant/graphs/commit-activity|

| DOI badge: exists |3 | https://github.com/yliang123/TeamFormationAssistant#readme|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |3|https://github.com/yliang123/TeamFormationAssistant/tree/master/docs|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |3| |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3| |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3 | evidence in youtube[https://youtu.be/WLMfi0sLFsA] and [https://youtu.be/Xtcq-58arUU] |
| Use of version control tools| 3|https://github.com/yliang123/TeamFormationAssistant |

| test cases exist|3|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base|
| test cases are routinely executed|3 |e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3| |
| issues are discussed before they are closed| 3| even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
| Chat channel: exists| 3| |
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3| |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3| |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3| |
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3| |
