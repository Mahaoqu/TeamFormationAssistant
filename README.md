# Team Formation Assistant

## Problem Statement

Build an assistant for project management(which will take the project requirements, team members availability, skill level, tools preferred, etc. as input and assigns the employees for projects) & job management(which allows users to apply to jobs and manager to review the applications or audit applications automatically by Machine Learning algorithm).
<br/>

## Project Objectives

➢ Design a form for the manager to enter projects requirements & new jobs informations.<br/>
➢ Design a dashboard to showcase the generated projects assignments & jobs assignments.<br/>
➢ Create and Manage a database with employees, Projects, Assignments data.<br/>
➢ Write an algorithm which will take the project requirements, team members availability, skill level, tools preferred, etc. as input and assigns the applicants for new jobs and employees for the new projects.<br/>


## Reasons to pick this project in Project 3:

## How we plan to carry out the project

### Algorithm Implementation

We plan to code the application in Python3. Python ML libraries will be used for
Cluster identification.<br/>

### Database Implementation:

We plan to store team members into an MySQL database. Python files import the
data and process it and store the final result back to the database.<br/>

### Frontend Implementation:

Team members will be able to submit a form to consider them as part of project
assignment.
Final team assignment will posted on the homepage dashboard. We plan to
implement the dashboard and form using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Linting: Code Styling, Formatting and Syntax Checking:
Flake8, ESlint, Prettier

### Automated Analysis Tool used:
[Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/yliang123/TeamFormationAssistant)

##### We have created a wiki page containing project details including project workflow, setup, dictionary, data model,
